# 🧬 Serverless DNA

Building production-ready serverless solutions on AWS

Serverless DNA is an open-source organization providing battle-tested CDK constructs, architectural patterns, and developer tooling for building scalable serverless applications on AWS. We focus on sharing practical, production-grade solutions that help teams adopt serverless technologies with confidence.

## 🎯 Mission

Accelerate serverless adoption by providing:

- Reusable CDK constructs for common serverless patterns
- Developer tooling that enhances serverless workflows
- AI integration tools connecting LLMs to documentation and services
- Best practices derived from real-world implementations

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [mkdocs-mcp](https://github.com/serverless-dna/mkdocs-mcp) ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/serverless-dna/mkdocs-mcp?style=social)
